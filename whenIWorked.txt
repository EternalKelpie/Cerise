added a simple map for testing, added colliders layer with render hiding script. 
Dynamic collider on player works, but kinematic has problems, don't know why.

using https://github.com/h8man/NavMeshPlus
trying to add oponent and simple move pattern. Also ai navigation


19.10 ~ 48 min

tried to fix ai navigation. 
i succesfully baked the area, but dont really know what helped? maybe navigation rootsources2d? but that is just a guess
oponent with nav mesh agent started to disapear, so i added agent.updateRotation = false;
agent.updateUpAxis = false in start function. it helped.


23.10 ~ 1 hour 50 min

i am looking for different pathfinding options for my oponnents, since build in AI Navigation is problematic to work with and even with a git plug it not as precise while baking the map as i want it to be.

Djikstrva vs A*.
i decided to try implementing a* since it is faster

i installed a package that is free, and started testing it. It implements a Star pathfinding algorithm


attempt to write it on my own

i added script for map, to see if it's walkable or not
